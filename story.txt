Far far away in the lands of Madison, Wisconsin, there was a little boy name Calliou. For some odd reason, Calliou is bald even though he's 4 and should probably
have hair by now. One day, Calliou decided that enough was enough and so he adventured out to try and find some hair. He left his house and almost immediately 
got lost because like I said before he's a 4 year old so he has no sense of direction. After some time of wandering around, Calliou finds a giant park. 
He sees many people with great haircuts. Everyone in the park has hair on their head except for himself. He gets angry and starts running around like a crazy maniac. Eventually he 
gets tired and starts walking towards a water fountain. He approaches the water fountain and sits right besides it. He remembers when he was 3, his mother would tell him stories about wishing fountain. So, then he proceeds to throw a rock in the fountain and wishes for some hair on his bald head. 

The instant the rock hits the water Calliou feels a new weight on his head. He slowly reaches his hand up to feel what he can only assume is his new head of hair.
But as his fingers make contact he realizes it's not hair at all. It's wet. It's smelly. It's bird shit. A bird shit on Calliou's stupid bald head. 
At this point Calliou realizes there's no recovering from what just happened, so he decides to do the only reasonable thing that can be done in a moment like this.
He launches himself, bald head first, straight into the fountain. As his heavy bald head sinks the bottom, Calliou accepts his fate.
Eventually an old couple happens upon Calliou floating face down in a fountain. They pull him out and call 911, but it's too late. Calliou is dead.
