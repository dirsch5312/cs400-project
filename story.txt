Far far away in the lands of Madison, Wisconsin, there was a little boy name Calliou. For some odd reason, Calliou is bald even though he's 4 and should probably
have hair by now. One day, Calliou decided that enough was enough and so he adventured out to try and find some hair. He left his house and almost immediately 
got lost because like I said before he's a 4 year old so he has no sense of direction. After some time of wandering around, Calliou finds a giant park.
